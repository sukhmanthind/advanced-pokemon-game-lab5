A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

# Pokémon TCG Battle App

## Overview
This is a Flutter application that fetches two random Pokémon cards from the Pokémon TCG API, compares their HP values, and declares a winner. Users can reload new cards by clicking a button.

## How It Works
1. The app fetches a list of Pokémon cards from the [Pokémon TCG API](https://pokemontcg.io/).
2. It randomly selects two cards and displays their images and HP values.
3. The app compares their HP values and announces a winner.
4. Clicking the "Load New Cards" button fetches two new random cards and repeats the process.

## Key Files
- **main.dart**: The core Flutter application containing UI, API logic, and winner determination.
- **pubspec.yaml**: Includes dependencies such as `http` for API requests.

## Original Source and Modifications
- The project was built from scratch using Flutter.
- The `http` package was added to facilitate API calls.
- The app's logic was implemented to handle random selection, API parsing, and UI updates.
- The user interface was designed with `Column`, `Row`, and `Image.network` widgets for an optimal layout.

## Why These Changes?
- To meet the requirements of fetching Pokémon TCG cards and dynamically updating the UI.
- To ensure a responsive and interactive experience for users.
- To allow smooth API integration and error handling.

## Installation and Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pokemon-tcg-battle.git

3. Install dependencies:

4. Run the app:

   ```

## Dependencies
- Flutter SDK

## Future Enhancements
- Improve error handling for API failures.
- Add animations for better visual effects.
- Allow users to select specific Pokémon for battle.
